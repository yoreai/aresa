The development of curative therapies is challenging due to the need for the delivery of gene-editing tools into skeletal muscle cells throughout the body. Here, we use muscular fusogens (Myomaker and Myomerger) to engineer muscle-specific virus-like particles (MuVLPs) for the systemic delivery of gene-editing tools. We demonstrate that MuVLPs can be loaded with diverse payloads, including EGFP, Cre and Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoproteins (Cas9 RNPs), and can be delivered into skeletal muscle cells via targeted membrane fusion. Systemic administration of MuVLPs carrying Cas9 RNPs enables skeletal muscle-specific gene editing, which excised the exon containing a premature terminator codon mutation in a mouse model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This treatment restores dystrophin expression in various skeletal muscle tissues, including the diaphragm, quadriceps, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and triceps. As a result, the treated mice exhibit a significantly increased capacity for exercise and endurance. This study established a platform for precise gene editing in skeletal muscle tissues.\n\nMeSH Terms: Animals, Gene Editing, Muscle, Skeletal, Mice, Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne, CRISPR-Cas Systems, Dystrophin, Genetic Therapy, Humans, Disease Models, Animal",

METHODS: This review investigated studies on gene editing interventions in animal models of CVDs, retrieved from PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science up to December 2024. RESULT: A total of 57 studies were included in this review. Mice (86%) were the predominant model, with CRISPR-Cas9 (53%) and AAV vectors (80%) as the most used tools. Key targets included PCSK9 (32%), LDLR (9%), and MYH6/7 (7%), achieving 25-85% editing efficiency in liver/heart tissues.

Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors have shown great promise in clinical trials as vehicles for delivering therapeutic transgenes and other cargos but currently face multiple limitations for effective delivery of gene editing machineries. This review elucidates these challenges and highlights the latest engineering strategies aimed at improving the efficiency, specificity, and safety profiles of AAV-packaged CRISPR/Cas systems (AAV-CRISPR) to enhance their clinical utility.",

The CD41-42 (-TCTT) mutation at HBB is the most prevalent pathogenic mutation of &#x3b2;-thalassemia in both China and Southeast Asia. Previous studies focused on repairing the HBB CD41-42 (-TCTT) mutation in &#x3b2;-thalassemia patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells, which were subsequently differentiated into hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) for transplantation. In this study, we directly applied the CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing therapy to correct the HBB CD41-42 (-TCTT) mutation in patient-derived HSPCs. The effective editing induced by Cas9:sgRNA ribonucleoprotein and single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) was confirmed in HUDEP-2 cell lines harboring the HBB CD41-42 (-TCTT) mutation. Further correction of heterozygote and homozygote HBB CD41-42 (-TCTT) mutations in patient-derived HSPCs resulted in a 13.4-40.8% increase in the proportion of HBB-expressing (HBB&#x2009;+) cells following erythroid differentiation in vitro.

By delivering an mRNA-LNP encoded membrane-bound immunogen displaying three conserved HIV-1 Envelope (Env) epitopes to knock-in mouse models with B cell receptors (BCRs) of defined affinities, we investigated how epitope-specific competition shapes germinal center (GC) responses. Co-activation of B cells targeting different epitopes did not alter GC kinetics observed in individual activations, but a striking inverse correlation was observed between BCR affinity and GC residence time in either scenario: high-affinity B cells exhibited shorter persistence in GCs, while those with lower affinity to the antigen were maintained. Furthermore, B cells were able to engage in GC reactions at equivalent rates in the presence or absence of clonal lineages binding the same epitope with similar affinities, while higher-affinity clones suppressed lower-affinity counterparts targeting the same epitope. Spatial transcriptomics revealed plasma-like cells within and adjacent to the GC which, together with the detection of early IgG in draining lymph nodes, suggests that local antibody production from these cells may contribute to feedback-driven kinetics. These findings indicate that a self-modulated local antibody feedback loop may act as a \"brake\" on epitope-specific recognition-dampening further affinity enhancement for high-affinity B cells and facilitating epitope spreading by redirecting the response toward alternative epitopes.",

We tested whether unvaccinated individuals in 2022 were wilfully avoiding vaccine information, or if they would voluntarily accept vaccine education. METHODS: In this double-blind, parallel, randomised educational study, we recruited US residents to participate in an online survey-experiment between 27 January 2022 and 25 February 2022. Subjects were first screened for vaccination status. Unvaccinated individuals were then separately invited into the survey. We developed video-based informational interventions that provide detailed, yet easy-to-grasp, explanations of mRNA vaccine technology, development, testing and safety protocols, and potential side effects. Participants were randomised into three groups: (1) a control group who watched an unrelated placebo video, (2) a 'video-optional' group for whom every informational video was optional and (3) a 'video-required' group for whom the vaccine-technology video was mandatory, but all other videos were optional. Primary endpoints were future COVID-19 vaccine uptake intentions, COVID-19 vaccine efficacy beliefs and COVID-19 vaccine side-effect concerns (all measured on a 100-point scale). Secondary endpoints measured information-seeking behaviour and trust in healthcare professionals. RESULTS: Relative to control (3014 participants), the video-optional group (1320 participants) exhibited a 0.09 standard deviation (95%&#x2009;CI 0.02 to 0.15) improvement in COVID-19 vaccine intentions, a 0.10 SD (95%&#x2009;CI 0.03 to 0.17) improvement in COVID-19 vaccine-efficacy beliefs, and a 0.14 SD (95%&#x2009;CI 0.07 to 0.21) improvement in COVID-19 side-effect concerns.

The rise in the drug resistance have made the traditional control measures, such as chemotherapy and vector management, inadequate against them. These are the intracellular infectious agent and possess complex life cycles, antigenic variability, and immune evasion abilities. These different abilities hinder the development of vaccines against them. Hence, there is urgent need for development of effective vaccines by novel measures. However, notable progress has been made in past years due to the advancements in immunology, molecular biology, and biotechnology. Different types of vaccines including subunit vaccines have been developed and have demonstrated favorable efficiency. In the meantime, live-attenuated vaccines (LAV) continue to provide protection in animals. Apart from that, there are different innovations like CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing that have enabled the creation of genetically attenuated strains for T. gondii and Eimeria. These attenuated strains are used for the development of vaccines. Furthermore, mRNA vaccine technology, which was successfully utilized during the COVID-19 pandemic, is now being used against parasitic infections. It is now offering fast and rapid development along with vigorous cellular immunity. The use of nanoparticles and novel adjuvants such as TLR agonists and saponins has improved the stability and effectiveness of vaccines. Approaches like mucosal delivery, especially for enteric parasites such as Cryptosporidium and Eimeria, is achieving attention for their ability to provide the localized protection. In spite of these advancements some challenges still persist. Antigenic diversity, short-lived immunity, regulatory barriers, and limited funding need to be addressed. Some of the emerging technologies including systems vaccinology, reverse vaccinology, and vectored delivery platforms, are paving the way for more targeted and effective vaccination. There is need for concerted effort incorporating multidisciplinary research, One Health integration, and scalable manufacturing methodologies for effective translation of these scientific innovations into solutions. By harnessing these emerging technologies within a One Health framework, the next generation of vaccines has the potential to transform the management of apicomplexan diseases worldwide.\n\nMeSH Terms: Protozoan Vaccines, Animals, Humans, Apicomplexa, Vaccine Development, Vaccines, Attenuated, COVID-19, Toxoplasma, Protozoan Infections, Vaccines, Subunit",

In the matched cohort study of neuro-ophthalmology patients, those treated using agents other than semaglutide had NAION rates, orders of magnitude higher than a background population, presumably because referral patterns led to the enrichment of the study populations with patients at high risk of NAION. With semaglutide, the rates of NAION were 4.28 and 7.64 times higher for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity, respectively, and onset of NAION was within 14&#x2009;months of treatment initiation, whereas non-semaglutide NAION was evenly distributed over the 3&#x2009;years of follow-up. Of four health care registry studies, each covering more than 100&#x2009;000 patients, two found relative rates of NAION two to three times higher with semaglutide than without semaglutide, one found a trend towards semaglutide being associated with NAION in patients with type 2 diabetes only, and one found statistically insignificant imbalances between the two alternatives. The meta-analysis of various GLP-1 receptor agonists versus placebo or active comparator found no significant difference in rates of NAION. Prior reports of long-term glycaemia reduction being associated with early worsening of retinopathy and with NAION indicate that semaglutide may promote such events in proportion to its antihyperglycaemic potency. The association of NAION with small, crowded discs, optic disc oedema and peripapillary exudation suggests that semaglutide-related NAION may result from changes in perfusion that lead to venous dilation and, presumably, to venous congestion during relative hypoglycaemia. Given the retrospective nature of the epidemiological studies, causality cannot be inferred, but a cautious approach to the use of semaglutide and other powerful glycaemia-reducing agents seems warranted, particularly in patients with crowded optic discs, a characteristic that can be identified by proactive eye examination for disc-at-risk characteristics by the use of optical coherence tomography.\n\nMeSH Terms: Humans, Glucagon-Like Peptides, Optic Neuropathy, Ischemic, Hypoglycemic Agents, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Global Health, Glucagon-Like Peptide 1",

Despite the development of several drugs for neuropathic pain management, their poor efficacy, tolerance, addiction potential, and side effects limit their usage. Teneligliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, has been shown to reduce spinal astrocyte activation and neuropathic pain caused by partial sciatic nerve transection. Additionally, we showed its capacity to improve the analgesic effects of morphine and reduce analgesic tolerance. Recent studies indicate that GLP-1 synthesized in the brain activates GLP-1 receptor signaling pathways, essential for neuroprotection and anti-inflammatory effects. Multiple in vitro and in vivo studies using preclinical models of neurodegenerative disorders have shown the anti-inflammatory properties associated with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) activation. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of antinociception and the effects of the GLP-1 agonist semaglutide (SEMA) on diabetic neuropathic pain in diabetic rats. RESULTS: SEMA treatment significantly reduced both allodynia and hyperalgesia in the diabetic group. SEMA therapy had a limited impact on body weight restoration and blood glucose reduction. In diabetic rats, SEMA lowered the amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord and dorsal horn. It also lowered the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the dorsal horn. SEMA significantly reduced HbA1c and AGE levels in diabetic rats compared to the sham control group. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate SEMA's neuroprotective benefits against diabetic neuropathic pain, most likely by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress by inhibiting astrocyte and microglial activity.

Semaglutide would thus seem to be a potential candidate for the treatment of BED. METHODS: This open-label study examined the effects of semaglutide on Binge Eating Scale (BES) scores in individuals with BED. Patients were divided into three groups: those prescribed semaglutide, those prescribed either lisdexamphetamine or topiramate, and those prescribed a combination of semaglutide with lisdexamphetamine or topiramate. RESULTS: Patients receiving semaglutide only exhibited greater reductions in BES scores compared to the other groups. Combined pharmacotherapy with both semaglutide and the other anti-obesity medications did not result in greater reductions in BES scores compared to the semaglutide-only group.

The off-label use of Ozempic (Novo Nordisk, Bagsv&#xe6;rd, Denmark), the brand name of the GLP-1 agonist semaglutide, for cosmetic weight loss has been popularized by social media and celebrity influence. The aim of this study was to analyze with Google Trends (Alphabet Inc., Mountain View, CA) the recent search popularity of Ozempic and related GLP-1 agonists. The term \"Ozempic\" was analyzed with Google Trends. Search popularity was assessed in terms of relative search volume (RSV) over a 5-year period. Changes in RSV were further compared with other GLP-1 agonists, \"Wegovy\" (Novo NordisK) and \"Mounjaro\" (Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN). Between March 2018 and February 2023, overall RSV in \"Ozempic\" grew exponentially in the United States. Simple linear regression analysis showed significantly increased RSV over time with an R2 of 0.915 and a regression coefficient of 0.957 (P &lt; .001). When comparing \"Ozempic,\" \"Wegovy,\" and \"Mounjaro\" since June 2021 (FDA approval of Wegovy), Ozempic remained at the greatest RSV. One-way analysis of variance found statistically significant differences between the 3 search terms at all time points between December 2021 and February 2023 (P &lt; .001). This study demonstrates a significant and growing public interest in Ozempic and related GLP-1 agonists. As the use of GLP-1 agonists for weight loss becomes more prevalent, plastic surgeons, particularly in the aesthetic setting, must be prepared for the downstream implications. Increased awareness, understanding, and further scientific studies led by plastic surgeons will help deliver the safest possible patient outcomes.\n\nMeSH Terms: Humans, United States, Hypoglycemic Agents, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Off-Label Use, Search Engine, Weight Loss, Glucagon-Like Peptide 1",

        "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists are a drug class used for the treatment of diabetes that have recently gained FDA approval for medical management of obesity. The off-label use of Ozempic (Novo Nordisk, Bagsv&#xe6;rd, Denmark), the brand name of the GLP-1 agonist semaglutide, for cosmetic weight loss has been popularized by social media and celebrity influence. The aim of this study was to analyze with Google Trends (Alphabet Inc., Mountain View, CA) the recent search popularity of Ozempic and related GLP-1 agonists. The term \"Ozempic\" was analyzed with Google Trends. Search popularity was assessed in terms of relative search volume (RSV) over a 5-year period. Changes in RSV were further compared with other GLP-1 agonists, \"Wegovy\" (Novo NordisK) and \"Mounjaro\" (Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN). Between March 2018 and February 2023, overall RSV in \"Ozempic\" grew exponentially in the United States. Simple linear regression analysis showed significantly increased RSV over time with an R2 of 0.915 and a regression coefficient of 0.957 (P &lt; .001). When comparing \"Ozempic,\" \"Wegovy,\" and \"Mounjaro\" since June 2021 (FDA approval of Wegovy), Ozempic remained at the greatest RSV. One-way analysis of variance found statistically significant differences between the 3 search terms at all time points between December 2021 and February 2023 (P &lt; .001). This study demonstrates a significant and growing public interest in Ozempic and related GLP-1 agonists. As the use of GLP-1 agonists for weight loss becomes more prevalent, plastic surgeons, particularly in the aesthetic setting, must be prepared for the downstream implications. Increased awareness, understanding, and further scientific studies led by plastic surgeons will help deliver the safest possible patient outcomes.",

Cagrilintide is an amylin-analog, now being developed in combination with the GLP-1 agonist semaglutide to achieve sustained weight loss in persons with overweight and obesity. Amylin, released with insulin from beta cells in the pancreas, induces its satiating effect via both the homoeostatic and hedonic regions of the brain. Semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, reduces appetite via GLP-1 receptors in the hypothalamus and increases the production of insulin, and reduces glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying. These separate, but related mechanisms of action of an amylin-analog and a GLP-1 receptor agonist appear to have an additive effect on appetite reduction. Given the heterogeneity and complex pathogenesis of obesity, combination therapy with multiple pathophysiological targets is a logical approach to increasing weight loss response with pharmacotherapy.

Mobile genetic elements such as integrons are key factors in the spread of resistance genes in pathogens like K.pneumoniae. This study aimed to detect class 1 and class 2 integron gene cassettes in K.pneumoniae isolates from VAP patients. A total of 22 isolates were collected between 2022 and 2023 from the intensive care unit of K&#x131;r&#x15f;ehir Training and Research Hospital. DNA was extracted using the boiling method and integrons were amplified via polymerase chain reaction with specific primers. Amplified fragments were cloned into the pJET1.2/blunt vector and sequenced. Sequences were processed using BioEdit and compared with the NCBI BLAST GenBank database to identify gene cassette contents. Identified sequences were submitted to GenBank and assigned accession numbers. Class 1 integrons were found in five isolates (22.7%) and class 2 integrons in two isolates (9.1%). Class 1 integrons harboured dfrA12 responsible for trimethoprim resistance and aadA which provides resistance to aminoglycoside group antibiotics. In class 2 integrons, dfrA1, sat2 and aadA1 were identified which confer resistance to trimethoprim, streptothricin and streptomycin/spectinomycin, respectively. The results of this study demonstrate that integrons play a significant role in the spread of hospital-acquired MDR K.pneumoniae isolates. Strengthening infection control measures and monitoring antibiotic resistance mechanisms are crucial for controlling antibiotic-resistant isolates seen in hospitals. This study will contribute to understanding the genetic makeup of VAP-related K.pneumoniae isolates, determining appropriate treatment approaches and controlling hospital-acquired infections.\n\nMeSH Terms: Humans, Integrons, Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella Infections, Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Drug Resistance, Bacterial, DNA, Bacterial",

ECHO India initiated a training program across four states to enhance the capacity of medical officers (MOs) to manage long COVID syndrome. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of the ECHO tele-mentoring program on long COVID management in public health facilities in terms of change in knowledge, competence, and performance of the trained MOs. METHODS: Mixed-methods approaches were adopted. Moore's Expanded Outcomes Framework was used for the study. Differences between the pre- and post-interventions were used to populate levels 1-5 of the framework with the trained MOs. This was supplemented by key informant interviews with stakeholders, i.e., trained MOs, hub leaders, and trainers. Level 6 was evaluated with patients seeking services for long COVID from the trained MOs. through quantitative exit interviews and in-depth interviews in two intervention states. RESULTS: The pre-post analyses were conducted on a sample size of 204 MOs; a total of 420 beneficiary patients were surveyed. In-depth interviews were done with another 20 patients to measure satisfaction. The findings reveal a significant increase in the MOs' knowledge, learning, and competence. MOs expressed appreciation for the interactive nature of the tele-mentoring sessions and reported increased confidence in dealing with long COVID cases. The training improved the MOs' focus on mental health as a treatment strategy for long COVID. Patients interviewed expressed satisfaction with the care provided by the MOs, in particular with communication skills and the comprehensive approach adopted for long COVID management. They valued the information, the thorough examinations, and the recommendations given by the trained MOs. CONCLUSION: The ECHO tele-mentoring program improved the knowledge and skills of primary care medical officers and also resulted in patient satisfaction.\n\nMeSH Terms: Humans, COVID-19, India, Female, Male, Telemedicine, Middle Aged, Adult, SARS-CoV-2, Mentoring",

Currently, research is ongoing regarding risk factors for developing Long COVID. Identifying patients susceptible to symptoms of Long COVID can assist with identifying those at risk, and developing preventative strategies for these individuals. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are to evaluate a cohort of patients who followed up in the Long COVID clinic who were experiencing cardiopulmonary symptoms 8-12&#xa0;weeks from initial inoculation, and to retrospectively identify any statistically significant risk factors or clinical features present. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined patients identified between April 2021 and September 2022. Patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and developed persistent symptoms were subsequently referred to the post-COVID-19 pulmonary clinic. For the cohort of patients seen in post COVID-19 pulmonary clinic, pre-existing pulmonary and systemic disease, severity of COVID-19 illness, and treatments received were examined. Analysis was performed on these data utilizing Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-six (246) adult patients who had Long COVID symptoms 8-12&#xa0;weeks post-COVID-19 infection were identified and included in this analysis. Cox regression analysis indicated that in this population, patients who had required oxygen support (supplemental oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, or intubation) during their initial COVID-19 hospitalization and who also had prior history of either obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and were more likely to develop Long COVID symptoms. Patients with pre-existing OSA had an odds ratio (OR) of 3.6 and a 95&#x202f;% confidence interval (CI) of 1.70-7.65 (p=0.0012). Patients with pre-existing COPD had an OR of 12.19 and a 95&#x202f;% CI of 2.38-62.33 (p=0.0015). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who required oxygen support during their initial COVID-19 hospitalization who also had previous history of either OSA or COPD were more likely to develop cardiopulmonary Long COVID symptoms. This suggests that pre-existing respiratory conditions and the severity of the initial COVID-19 illness may influence the development of these symptoms of Long COVID.",

However, data on children and adolescents remain limited. This study aims to explore visual perception and neuropsychiatric symptoms in pediatric patients and examine their associations with brain volume differences. METHODS: A total of 60 participants, aged six to 18 years and confirmed COVID-19 antibody positive, were recruited five to eight months after infection. Owing to the diversity of symptoms, each symptom was assigned a weighted score from 0 to 3 based on its severity and relevance to brain function. Participants were then divided into two groups according to symptom severity. All participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging, and the Test of Visual Perceptual Skills-Fourth Edition (TVPS-4) was administered. RESULTS: The most common neuropsychiatric symptoms were headache or dizziness, along with attention and memory deficits, which persisted for up to six months. Gray matter volumes were significantly increased in the group with severe symptoms, particularly in subcortical and temporal regions. These brain volume differences showed significant correlations with both acute and chronic symptoms. In the TVPS-4 assessment, significant differences were observed in overall standard scores and in the Sequential Memory subtest between participants with visual-related symptoms and healthy control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms, impaired visual perception, and gray matter volume differences are evident in pediatric long COVID cases. The severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms during the acute phase may predict the degree of chronic-phase brain volume alterations. Longitudinal follow-up studies are essential to validate and expand upon these findings.\n\nMeSH Terms: Humans, Child, Male, COVID-19, Female, Adolescent, Visual Perception, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Brain, Gray Matter",

Increasing evidence highlights the complex interplay between the immune system, gut microbiota, and their bidirectional crosstalk with the central nervous system.&#xa0;Gut microbiota dysbiosis affects neuroimmune and intestinal immune homeostasis, driving bidirectional peripheral-central immune responses through immune-to-brain and gut-to-brain communication. This process involves impaired intestinal barrier integrity (bacterial translocation), systemic low-grade inflammation, activation of innate immune signaling pathways (e.g., TLR4 and NLRP3 inflammasomes), glial cell activation, neuroinflammation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, ultimately leading to neuronal injury and disturbances in mood, cognition, and behavior. Conversely, gut microbiota and their metabolites exert neuroprotective effects through facilitating neurotransmitter synthesis, regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, and modulating immune response. Collectively, these actions enhance synaptic plasticity, suppress hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, and maintain BBB integrity. Understanding these immune-mediated multidimensional mechanisms not only deepens our understanding of the pathophysiology of MDD but also provides new perspectives for identifying potential biomarkers and developing therapeutic targets.\n\nMeSH Terms: Humans, Depressive Disorder, Major, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Brain, Immune System, Animals, Brain-Gut Axis, Blood-Brain Barrier",

        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading psychiatric disorder with increasing global prevalence, yet its underlying pathogenesis remains inadequately elucidated. Increasing evidence highlights the complex interplay between the immune system, gut microbiota, and their bidirectional crosstalk with the central nervous system.&#xa0;Gut microbiota dysbiosis affects neuroimmune and intestinal immune homeostasis, driving bidirectional peripheral-central immune responses through immune-to-brain and gut-to-brain communication. This process involves impaired intestinal barrier integrity (bacterial translocation), systemic low-grade inflammation, activation of innate immune signaling pathways (e.g., TLR4 and NLRP3 inflammasomes), glial cell activation, neuroinflammation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, ultimately leading to neuronal injury and disturbances in mood, cognition, and behavior. Conversely, gut microbiota and their metabolites exert neuroprotective effects through facilitating neurotransmitter synthesis, regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, and modulating immune response. Collectively, these actions enhance synaptic plasticity, suppress hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, and maintain BBB integrity. Understanding these immune-mediated multidimensional mechanisms not only deepens our understanding of the pathophysiology of MDD but also provides new perspectives for identifying potential biomarkers and developing therapeutic targets.",

Conventional treatment for PD involves dopamine therapy, including levodopa; however, this treatment is ineffective for nonmotor symptoms and may cause adverse effects. The gut-brain axis has been hypothesized to promote PD, and regulation of gut microbiome, which modulates the gut-brain axis, is emerging as a treatment target. Acupuncture and moxibustion exert therapeutic effects on PD and modulate the gut microbial composition. OBJECTIVE: We present a protocol for analyzing the effects of acupuncture and moxibustion on gut microbiome and exploring its association with symptoms in patients with PD. METHODS: This single-group, prospective, observational study will recruit 60 patients with idiopathic PD and 20 healthy participants. Baseline gut microbiome patterns and motor and nonmotor symptoms of both groups will be compared. Patients with PD will be treated with acupuncture, moxibustion, and intradermal acupuncture twice a week for 12 weeks (24 sessions total). Motor and nonmotor symptoms and gut microbiome changes in patients with PD will be compared before starting treatment (day 0), during treatment (6 weeks), at the end of treatment (12 weeks), and 2 months after the end of treatment (20 weeks). The correlation between motor and nonmotor symptoms of PD changed by acupuncture and moxibustion treatment and changes in gut microbiome will be analyzed. Healthy participants will be assessed for motor and nonmotor symptoms of PD and gut microbiome after screening. RESULTS: This study was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea, funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (Information and Communication Technology), Republic of Korea, and recruitment for the study started on October 21, 2021. As of February 19, 2025, recruitment and observation ended, and data analysis is being conducted. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first clinical study to assess the effects of acupuncture and moxibustion on gut microbiome and explore its association with symptoms in patients with PD. The results will provide clinical evidence to explain the microbiome-gut-brain axis mechanism of acupuncture and moxibustion for PD and suggest the possibility of acupuncture as an alternative therapy for PD.

Chronic stress represents a major contributing factor, with the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis playing a critical role in its pathophysiology. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to evaluate whether hypericin can ameliorate depression through MGB axis and its underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To evaluate the antidepressant potential of hypericin, a chronic restraint stress mouse model was established. Behavioral tests were conducted. Fecal 16S rRNA sequencing and serum untargeted metabolomics were performed to investigate alterations in gut microbiota and metabolic profiles, followed by integrative analysis. The glycerophospholipid signaling pathway was further examined in both colon and hippocampus. Finally, microbiota depletion experiments were carried out to validate the essential role of gut microbiota in mediating the antidepressant effects of hypericin. RESULTS: Hypericin ameliorated anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, accompanied by reduced histological damage, inflammation, and dysregulated serotonin metabolism in both the colon and hippocampus. Furthermore, significant alterations in Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) abundance and glycerophospholipid metabolites were observed after hypericin treatment, with strong correlations identified among A. muciniphila, differential glycerophospholipid metabolites, and behavioral scores. The sPLA2/LPCATs/LYPLA1 axis was further demonstrated to mediate hypericin's regulatory effects on glycerophospholipid metabolism in both tissues. Finally, microbiota depletion abolished the behavioral improvements induced by hypericin. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our findings offer novel insights into the role of the MGB axis in mediating the antidepressant effects of hypericin, potentially through mechanisms involving the modulation of A. muciniphila and glycerophospholipid metabolism.\n\nMeSH Terms: Animals, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Depression, Anthracenes, Male, Mice, Glycerophospholipids, Antidepressive Agents, Perylene, Hippocampus",
