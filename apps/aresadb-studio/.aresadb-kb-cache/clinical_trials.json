Zolbetuximab with chemotherapy may be used to treat stomach and GEJ cancer when the cancer cells do not have a protein called HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) on their surface (HER2-negative) but do have a protein called Claudin 18.2 (Claudin 18.2-positive). Zolbetuximab is thought to work by attaching to the Claudin 18.2 protein in their tumor, which switches on the body's immune system to attack the tumor. Certain stomach and GEJ cancers may be treated with immunotherapy, which helps the body's immune system fight cancer. This study will give more information about how well zolbetuximab works when given with an immunotherapy medicine called pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. In this study, adults with stomach cancer or GEJ cancer will either be given zolbetuximab with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy or a placebo with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. A placebo looks like zolbetuximab but doesn't have any medicine in it.\n\nThe main aim of the study is to check how long people with stomach cancer and GEJ cancer live after treatment with zolbetuximab with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy compared to placebo with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy.\n\nAdults with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic stomach cancer or GEJ cancer can take part. Locally advanced means the cancer has spread to nearby tissue. Unresectable means the cancer cannot be removed by surgery. Metastatic means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. A tumor sample (biopsy) of their cancer will have the Claudin 18.2 protein, PD-L1 protein, and be HER2-negative. They may have been previously treated with certain standard therapies. People cannot take part if they need to take medicines to suppress their immune system, have blockages or bleeding in their gut, have specific uncontrollable cancers such as symptomatic or untreated cancers in the nervous system, or have a specific heart condition, or infections.\n\nThe study treatments are either zolbetuximab with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, or placebo with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. People who take part will receive just 1 of the study treatments by chance. The people in the study and the study doctors will not know who takes which of the study treatments. Study treatment will be given in 6-week (42-day) cycles. The study treatment is mainly given to people slowly through a tube into a vein. This is called an infusion. People will receive study treatment as follows: Zolbetuximab or placebo: 1 infusion every 2 or 3 weeks (2 or 3 infusions in a cycle) together with: Chemotherapy (1 of the following types of chemotherapy): 1. CAPOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin): 1 infusion of oxaliplatin every 3 weeks (2 infusions in a cycle). People will also take 1 tablet of capecitabine twice a day for 2 weeks (14 days) at the start of each cycle (Day 1) and again in the middle of each cycle (Day 22). After 8 study treatments people will receive capecitabine only. 2. Modified FOLFOX6 or mFOLFOX6 (5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and oxaliplatin): 1 infusion every 2 weeks (3 infusions in a cycle). After 12 study treatments people will receive folinic acid and fluorouracil only, instead of mFOLFOX6. Pembrolizumab: 1 infusion every 3 or 6 weeks (1 or 2 infusions in a cycle). People can be in the study and will receive study treatment until their cancer worsens, they cannot tolerate the study treatment, or they need to start another cancer treatment. People may receive pembrolizumab for up to 2 years. People will visit the clinic on certain days to receive their study treatment and have health checks. The study doctors will check if people had any medical problems from taking zolbetuximab or the other study treatments. On some visits they will have scans to check for any changes in their cancer. People will have the option of giving a tumor sample if they stop treatment because their cancer has worsened. People will visit the clinic after they stop their study treatment. People will be asked about any medical problems and will have a health check. People will continue to have scans every 9 or 12 weeks to check for any changes in their cancer. They will have telephone health checks every 3 months. The number of visits and checks done at each visit will depend on the health of each person and whether they completed their study treatment or not.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participant has histologically confirmed gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.\n* Participant has radiographically confirmed, locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic disease within 28 days prior to randomization.\n* Participant has radiologically evaluable disease (measurable and/or nonmeasurable) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) V1.1, ≤ 28 days prior to randomization.

Due to the early recovery of conditions such as delirium and transient cognitive impairment after stroke, the diagnosis of PSCI often requires cognitive assessment at 12 to 24 weeks post-stroke to determine the severity of cognitive impairment. It can be classified according to the severity of cognitive impairment as post-stroke cognitive impairment no dementia (PSCIND) and post-stroke dementia (PSD). Recent large international cohort studies have reported an incidence rate of PSCI ranging from 24% to 53.4%, and patients with PSCI have a significantly higher mortality rate compared to those without cognitive impairment. Guidelines such as American Heart Association/American Society of Anesthesiologists (AHA/ASA) and the Chinese \"Expert Consensus on the Management of Post-Stroke Cognitive Impairment\" propose integrating cognitive impairment and stroke intervention strategies. Early comprehensive intervention and treatment for high-risk individuals after stroke, aiming to delay or prevent the progression from PSCIND to PSD, are the primary goals in the current treatment of PSCI. However, there is currently a lack of large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for PSCI, and research is still needed to determine whether cognitive-enhancing drugs can reduce the risk of PSCI occurrence and improve outcomes and prognosis for PSCI patients. A randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical study involving 281 non-dementia vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) patients showed that the overall cognitive scores of patients treated with donepezil for 24 weeks significantly improved compared to the placebo group.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of donepezil in the treatment of post-stroke cognitive impairment. It will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a 48-week treatment duration. The study will observe the difference in PSCI incidence rate between the donepezil treatment group and the conventional stroke treatment group at 24 weeks and evaluate the improvement in post-stroke cognitive impairment after 6 months of donepezil treatment compared to conventional treatment.\n\nThis study will be conducted in two stages: the first stage (0-24 weeks) aims to assess whether donepezil can reduce the risk of PSCI occurrence and will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The second stage (24-48 weeks) aims to evaluate whether donepezil can improve the prognosis of PSCI patients and will also be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\n\nFirst stage:\n\n* Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) symptom onset within 14 days Signs and symptoms consistent with the diagnosis of an acute ischemic stroke by CT/MRI.\n* Age \\>= 60 years，\n* Baseline NIHSS 3-18.\n* Patient can complete questionnaire survey, physical examination, cranial MRI and other medical examinations\n* Patient/legally authorized representative has signed the Informed Consent Form\n\nSecond stage:\n\n* Patient with stage I diagnosis of PSCI.\n* Patient can complete questionnaire survey, physical examination, cranial MRI and other medical examinations.\n* Patient/legally authorized representative has signed the Informed Consent Form\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nFirst stage:\n\n* Patients who had been diagnosed with dementia prior to stroke\n* Other related factors affecting cognitive function: central nervous system infection, neurodegenerative diseases, trauma, poisoning, intracranial space occupying lesions, metabolic diseases, etc.\n* Other serious central nervous syst\n\nPrimary Outcomes:\n- PSCI incidence\n- vadas-cog score",

The subject experiences an adverse event potentially attributable to the study drug that is deemed, in the opinion of one of the physicians on the study team or the MICU team, to warrant discontinuation of therapy.\n\nSummary:\nAbout one-third of the patients who develop mild, acute confusion (i.e., subsyndromal delirium) will go on to develop a severe acute confusional state (i.e. delirium). Delirium refers to a temporary change in the way a person thinks about things. Delirium occurs in patients admitted to the hospital particularly those patients that are very sick, who are given a number of medications, and who are not able to sleep normally. It affects their behavior, their understanding of the people and things around them, and their ability to make decisions. While ICU doctors do everything possible to eliminate the factors that may cause delirium, delirium may cause a person to become very agitated which if not controlled is dangerous to their safety as well as the safety of those around them. As well, if delirium develops in patients in the ICU, it may increase the risk for death, keep patients in both the ICU and hospital for longer and send patients to a long term care facility rather than home after they are discharged from the hospital. A recent medical report found that patients in the ICU who develop subsyndromal delirium have a mortality rate, a length of stay in both the ICU and the hospital, and a transfer rate to a long term care facility that is nearly as great as patients with delirium and greater than patients who develop neither subsyndromal delirium or delirium. Recent studies in non-ICU patients suggest that if a patient who is at high risk for developing delirium receives a medication called an antipsychotic (e.g. haloperidol) they may not be as likely to develop delirium or if they do develop delirium it will not last as long. No studies have evaluated the effect of administering an antipsychotic in patients in the ICU who have subsyndromal delirium. Another study completed in the ICUs at Tufts Medical Center found that there may be an association between the development of delirium in patients with subsyndromal delirium and the use of haloperidol. However, this small study had many limitations and thus it is not currently known whether using haloperidol in patients with subsyndromal delirium will actually cause fewer of these patients to develop delirium. Haloperidol makes a person sleepy and helps control behavior like agitation. Haloperidol is the drug that is used most often to help control delirium in the ICU. This prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled study will determine if haloperidol administered through the vein four times daily (1mg IV q6h) to patients who have subsyndromal delirium, and who are on a breathing machine and being cared for by the Medical ICU service at Tufts Medical Center, will help prevent patients from developing delirium. A total of 68 participants will be enrolled. Exclusion criteria are extensive and include conditions that could affect the ability to determine if delirium is present or increase the risk for side effects related to the administration of haloperidol. Patients older than 80 will be excluded from the study. Study medication (i.e. haloperidol) will be administered until one the following occurs: 1) delirium develops (that is confirmed by a staff psychiatrist or his designate, 2) the patient is discharged from the ICU at Tufts Medical Center, 3) the patient has received haloperidol or placebo for 10 days or 4) an adverse event potentially attributable to the study drug is experienced by a patient that is deemed, in the opinion of a pulmonologist member of the investigative team to warrant discontinuation of therapy. Haloperidol may cause unwanted side effects such as low blood pressure, twitching, and an unsafe abnormal heart rhythm. Patients with chronic confusion (e.g., a dementia such as Alzheimer's Disease) should not receive haloperidol and will not be included in this study. Patients will be carefully monitored for side effects that are potentially related to haloperidol. Patients who become confusion-free in the ICU before they leave the ICU (i.e., have no subsyndromal delirium) will be asked to provide consent for all research activities that occured in the ICU. If patients where cognition is regained (ie. no subsyndromal delirium or delirium) are not willing to provide consent then any study data collected from them while they were in the ICU will be destroyed and they will not be approached to participate in the post-ICU component of the study. This study also seeks to understand how the use of haloperidol in the ICU in patients with subsyndromal delirium may have affect memory, emotional status, happiness, ability to function, and quality of sleep in patients after they leave the ICU. Patients (that do not have delirium based on CAM screening at the time the 3-10 day and 6 month assessments are attempted) will be approached to participate in this post-ICU component of the study.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age 18-84 years old\n* Subsyndromal delirium (ICDSC of 1-3)\n* Mechanically ventilated\n* No objection from the MICU, CCU, or SICU service attending MD for enrollment\n* Admitted to the MICU, CCU, or SICU service at Tufts Medical Center\n* Patients is expected by their ICU attending physician to require admission to the ICU for ≥ 24 hours\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnancy\n* Delirium (ICDSC ≥ 4)\n* History of severe dementia or an Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE)) score ≥ 4\n* IQCODE is not able to be completed.\n* Current treatment with donepezil (aricept), tacrine (cognex), rivastigmine (exelon), or memantine (namenda)\n* Admitted with a neurologic diagnosis (e.g., CVA)\n* Past diagnosis of schizophrenia or a formal thought disorder as defined by DSM IV criteria.\n* Treatment with an antipsychotic agent in the 30 days prior to ICU admission\n* Current treatment with a neuromuscular blocker or dexmedetomidine\n* A patient requiring a level \n\nPrimary Outcomes:\n- Conversion from subsyndromal delirium to delirium during the period of study drug administration (up to 10 days).",

Deposition of amyloid fibrils of variant TTR (primarily V30M) in peripheral nerve tissue produces the condition called FAP.\n\nThe prevention of the formation of amyloid by stabilization of the TTR native state should constitute an effective therapy for amyloid diseases. Therapeutic intervention with a TTR stabilizer drug, such as Fx-1006A, is hypothesized to stop progression of the disease in FAP patients. FAP is a uniformly fatal disease and Fx-1006A is intended to halt the relentless neurological deterioration FAP patients experience.\n\nThis Phase 2/3 study will enroll early to mid-stage FAP patients in order to interrupt and stabilize the disease at a point in time where progression of motor and autonomic dysfunction can be maximally effected. Male and female patients with FAP with documented V30M TTR mutation will receive Fx-1006A or placebo once daily for a period of eighteen (18) months.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

Frequent nocturnal awakening is a common behavioral symptom of AD. Nighttime wandering and agitated behavior may result in injuries and sleep disruption for caregivers. Alternatives are sorely needed to the currently available sleep medications that have marginal efficacy and serious side effects. Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone secreted by the pineal gland. It has soporific effects with oral administration and is well tolerated. It enhances sleep in normal older people. Melatonin also may help sleep disturbances associated with AD; however, this remains to be proven.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must meet NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Patients must have disrupted sleep, documented by clinical history and by 1 to 2 weeks of recording using wrist activity monitors.\n* A diagnosis of probable AD.\n* MMSE score 0-26.\n* Hachinski Ischemia Scale score less than or equal to 4.\n* A 2-week history of two or more sleep disorder behaviors, occurring at least once weekly, as reported by the caregiver on the Sleep Disorder Inventory.\n* CT or MRI since the onset of memory problems showing no more than one lacunar infarct in a non-strategic area and no clinical events suggestive of stroke or other intracranial disease since the CT or MRI.\n* Physically acceptable for study as confirmed by medical history and exam, clinical laboratory results, and EKG.\n* Actigraph evidence of a mean nocturnal sleep time of less than 7 hours per night (at least 5 nights of complete actigraph data must be collected over a single week.\n* Stable home sit",

The primary endpoint of this study, mean change from baseline in total awake time spent \"off' is the same endpoint as used in the ropinirole PR pivotal study for advanced Parkinson's disease patients. This study includes a wide range of ropinirole doses (4-24mg) with the 8mg, 12mg, and 16mg per day doses powered to detect a 1.7 hour difference in total awake time spent \"off\" compared with placebo. The dose of Ldopa will remain stable through the study, unless the subject experiences tolerability issues that require an L-dopa dose reduction. Up to three L-dopa dose reductions are allowed, making a total reduction of up to approximately 30%. Keeping the L-dopa dose constant where possible is important to avoid confounding the efficacy data. Clinical review of the primary and secondary endpoints will be performed in order to establish the lowest maximally effective therapeutic dose.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (according to modified Hoehn \\& Yahr criteria Stages II-IV) and demonstrating lack of control with L-dopa therapy (e.g.\n\nend of dose akinesia, simple on/off fluctuations).\n\n* Subjects receiving a stable dose of L-dopa for at least 4 weeks prior to screening.\n* A minimum of 3 hours awake \"off-time\" for each diary day recorded during the baseline period.\n* Men or non-pregnant/non-breast-feeding women of at least 30 years of age at screening.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), including urinary incontinence (UI), urgency, and/or nocturia, are common non-motor symptoms that further diminish the already compromised quality of life for adults living with PD. Behavioral interventions for UI - including pelvic floor muscle exercise (PFME) therapy - have proven efficacy in randomized controlled trials and are free of side effects. Exercise-based behavioral therapy for UI requires individuals to learn a motor skill (PFME) and implement an adaptive behavioral strategy that incorporates the PFME to suppress urinary urgency and prevent UI.\n\nWe will conduct a two-site, randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of PFME-based behavioral therapy to treat urinary symptoms in adults with PD. After stratification by UI severity, PD severity, and gender, a group of 60 subjects (30 in each group) will be randomized to receive behavioral therapy or a behavioral control over 8 weeks in order to achieve a sample size of 50 individuals (25 in each group) who complete the study. A 6-month follow-up is planned in the treatment group.\n\nWe hypothesize that:\n\n1. PD participants who are randomized to the exercise-based behavioral therapy group (Group A) will report a significant reduction in weekly frequency of UI episodes compared to PD participants in the behavioral control group (Group B). The primary outcome, frequency of UI, will be measured using a seven-day bladder diary.\n2. Compared to PD participants in Group B, the reduction in UI frequency in Group A will be clinically meaningful as measured by a corresponding improvement on questionnaires of satisfaction and quality of life as well as a decline in other urinary symptoms including urgency and nocturia.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease determined by a board-certified neurologist with specialty training in movement disorders\n* ≥ 4 weekly episodes of UI and at least one episode per week associated with feelings of urgency, where urgency is defined as the complaint of a sudden compelling desire to void which is difficult to defer\n* Willingness to attend clinic visits\n* Willingness to keep 7-day bladder diaries throughout the study period\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Significant cognitive impairment, as indicated by a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of \\< 18.\n* Inability to produce an interpretable 7-day bladder diary at baseline\n* Previous intensive PFME training\n* Clinically significant depression as measured by a Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form score ≥ 10 which could affect motivation to fully engage in the intervention\n* Use of an indwelling urinary catheter\n* Bladder outlet obstruction defined as having been prescribed in-and-out catheteriz\n\nPrimary Outcomes:\n- Bladder diary",

However, sometimes the investigators observed a gait aggravation either with using high voltage and high frequencies, either because of suboptimal placement of electrode inside Forel H2 field. The most frequent hypothesise to explain this gait aggravation is a modulation of the activity of pedunculopontine nucleus due to a diffusion of the electric stimulation current to the fibbers going near STN area.\n\nThe primary purpose of this study is to compare the effect of deep brain stimulation with high frequency versus low frequency on gait of patients whatever the electrodes placement (STN ou Forel fields) and whatever the medication condition (with or without treatment).\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients :\n* Men or women aged between 45 -85 years\n* Patients with an idiopathic Parkinson's disease according to UKPDSBB criteria\n* Normal neurologic evaluation (except Parkinson's disease)\n* Patient treated with a deep brain stimulation according to the French consensus conference of treatment of Parkinson's disease (Consensus Conference Proceeding, 2000)\n* Affiliated to National Health system\n* Having given their informed consent\n\nHealthy subject\n\n* Men or women aged between 45 -85 years\n* Normal neurologic evaluation\n* Affiliated to National Health system\n* Having given their informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients :\n* Patients suffering of an atypical Parkinson syndrome\n* Patients with locomotive disorders which can interfere in gait evaluation\n* Patients with dementia (MMS \\<24)\n* Under guardianship\n* In excluding period for another study\n* Person who participate to an other study\n\nHealthy subject\n\n* Subject with locomotive disorders which can in\n\nPrimary Outcomes:\n- The step length (expressed in meter)",

Early treatment with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) plus conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) improves oxygenation, responsiveness being significantly influenced by alveolar recruitment level. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFV) is conceptually very attractive as constant mean airway pressure optimizes lung recruitment; this could maximize iNO effects.\n\nAims: To analyze the effects of HFV on oxygenation indexes in AHRF children under CMV and iNO.\n\nMethods: Children with AHRF (oxygenation index ≥10) aged between one month and 14 years under CMV with PEEP≥10cmH2O and 5ppm iNO for 1h were randomly assigned to CMV (CMVG, n=12) or HFV (HFVG, n=12) in a crossover design. Children with chronic cardiac or pulmonary diseases were excluded. Patients were kept under one of the two ventilation modes for 8h, crossing to the other for 8h, and then back again to complete 24h observation. Blood gas analysis, oxygenation indexes, and hemodynamic variables were recorded at enrollment (Tind), 1h after iNO start and then every 4h (T4h etc). The Mann-Whitney U test compared group ages and PRISM scores, and the Fisher test genders. Moments and groups were compared by repeated measure analysis for independent groups. Significance was considered at p\\<0.05.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Children with AHRF (oxygenation index ≥ 10) aged between one month and 14 years under CMV with PEEP ≥ 10 cmH2O and 5 ppm iNO for 1 hour.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Children with chronic cardiac or pulmonary diseases.\n\nPrimary Outcomes:\n- Oxygenation indexes",

Despite higher complications rates in earlier studies, current data suggest similar complication rates or better outcomes after the use of VCD as compared to manual compression. ExoSeal (Cordis, Warren, NJ, USA) is a new, extravascular polyglycol acid (PGA) plug which occludes the puncture channel. Whether the use of this extravascular closure device is as effective as the more widely used plug/anchor mediated devices, has not been evaluated so far.\n\nWe performed a randomized, multicentre, single-blinded trial to compare the efficacy of the extravascular closure device ExoSeal in comparison to the collagen-based plug/anchor mediated AngioSeal system.\n\nMethods:\n\n304 patients receiving diagnostic angiography and/or PCI will be included in three centers. Exclusion criteria are contraindications for any VCD including 1. severe calcification of the access vessel, 2. severe peripheral artery disease, 3. puncture in the origin of the profound femoral artery, 3. non-femoral sheath insertion, 4. marked tortuosity of the femoral or iliac artery, 5. marked obesity or cachexia (BMI \\>40 or \\<20) and 6. patients on continuous medication with oral anticoagulants.\n\nAfter the procedure, angiography of the accessed femoral artery is performed to rule out major risk factors for retroperitoneal hemorrhage, relevant peripheral stenoses of the common or the superficial femoral artery, or a location of the puncture site in the bifurcation of the profundal femoral artery.\n\nWe hypothesise, that the use of an extravascular closure device is not inferior to an anchor/plug mediated device regarding the occurrence of the following complications: bleeding, need for vascular surgery and device failure (primary endpoints). Secondary endpoints are the occurrence of false aneurysms, severe pain (Borg ≥ 5), and hematoma ≥ 5 cm within 24 hours after insertion of the device. Power was 80%, alpha 0.05. Bleeding will be defined according to the TIMI criteria. The study is actively enrolling patients, last inclusion will take place in September 2012.\n\nResults and Conclusions:\n\nOutcome data including the primary endpoint (bleeding, need for vascular surgery and device failure) will be presented for the first time.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* all patients who receive coronary angiography/intervention with an 6 F sheath\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* severe calcification of the access vessel,\n* severe peripheral artery disease,\n* puncture in the origin of the profound femoral artery,\n* non-femoral sheath insertion,\n* marked tortuosity of the femoral or iliac artery,\n* marked obesity or cachexia (BMI \\>40 or \\<20)\n* patients on continuous medication with oral anticoagulants.\n\nPrimary Outcomes:\n- bleeding, need for vascular surgery and device failure",

      "content": "Title: Effect of a Perioperative Opioid Free Anaesthesia-Analgesia (OFA-A) Strategy on Surgical Stress Response and Immunomodulation in Elective VATS Lobectomy for NSCLC Lung Cancer: A Prospective Randomized Study\nNCT ID: NCT05172739\nStatus: RECRUITING\nPhase: PHASE4\nSponsor: University of Crete\nEnrollment: 70 participants\n\nConditions: Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome, Postoperative Pain, Acute, Postoperative Pain, Chronic, Infections Postoperative, Opioid Use, Anesthesia, Non-small Cell Lung Cancer\n\nInterventions:\n- DRUG: Opioid-Based Anesthesia-Analgesia Strategy - A perioperative Opioid-Based multimodal Anesthesia- Analgesia strategy will be implemented that incorporates the following pharmacological agents:\n\nPremedication: Midazolam, Anaesthesia induction \\& maintenance: Midazolam, Propofol, Fentanyl, Cisatracurium or alternatively Rocuronium, Desflurane, Morphine, Paracetamol, Dexketoprofen trometamol, Ondansetron or Droperidol, Ropivacaine Surgical ward: Morphine, Paracetamol, Dexketoprofen trometamol Rescue therapy only: Tramadol\n- DRUG: Opioid-free Anesthesia-Analgesia Strategy - A perioperative Opioid-Based multimodal Anesthesia- Analgesia strategy will be implemented that incorporates the following pharmacological agents:\n\nPremedication: Pregabalin, Midazolam, Anesthesia induction \\& maintenance: Midazolam, Dexmedetomidine, Lidocaine, Propofol, Ketamine, Hyoscine, Cisatracurium or alternatively Rocuronium, Magnesium sulphate, Dexamethasone, Desflurane, Paracetamol, Dexketoprofen trometamol, Ondansetron or Droperidol, Ropivacaine, Surgical ward: Ketamine, Lidocaine, Clonidine, Droperidol and Midazolam, Pregabalin, Paracetamol, Dexketoprofen trometamol Rescue therapy only: Tramadol\n\nSummary:\nLobectomy is a major, high-risk surgical procedure that in addition to one-lung ventilation (OLV) exerts a potent surgical stress response. An overwhelming immune cell recruitment may lead to excessive tissue damage, peripheral organ injury and immunoparesis. The effect of anesthesia on the immune system is modest, compared to the effects induced by major surgery. However, to an immunocompromised patient, due to cancer and/or other comorbidities, the immunosuppressive effects of anesthesia may increase the incidence of post-operative infections, morbidity, and mortality. Exogenous opioids have been correlated with immunosuppression, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, and respiratory depression, with deleterious outcomes. An Opioid-Free Anaesthesia-Analgesia (OFA-A) strategy is based on the administration of a variety of anaesthetic/analgesic and other pharmacological agents with different mechanisms of action, including immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory effects. Our basic hypothesis is that the implementation of a perioperative multimodal OFA-A strategy, will lead to an attenuated surgical stress response and attenuated immunosuppression, compared to a conventional Opioid-Based Anaesthesia-Analgesia (OBA-A) strategy. The aforementioned effects, are presumed to be associated with equal or improved analgesia and decreased incidence of postoperative infections compared to a perioperative OBA-A technique.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* patients undergoing elective VATS lobectomy\n* early stage NSCLC (up to T3N1M0)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Immunocompromised patients\n* previous lung surgery\n* preoperative corticosteroid or immunosuppressive drug use\n* uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus\n* cardiac failure (NYHA 3 and 4)\n* preoperative infection (CRP \\>5mg/ml, WBC \\>10x10\\^9/L)\n* preoperative anemia (Hb\\<12g/dl)\n* chronic inflammatory diseases\n* inflammatory bowel disease\n\nGroup-specific exclusion criteria:\n\n* OFA-Α: perioperative opioid administration, within the study period\n* OBA-Α: perioperative dexmedetomidine or lidocaine infusion, ketamine, gabapentinoid or corticosteroid administration within the study period\n\nPrimary Outcomes:\n- Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio (NLR)\n- Platelet to Lymphocyte ratio (PLR)\n- Lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR)\n- Advanced Lung Cancer Inflammation Index (ALI)\n- Systemic Immune Inflammation Index (SII)\n- Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI)\n- Surgical Stress Response -

This positive fluid balance is the consequence of different organ failures (pulmonary, cardio-vascular, kidney…) or aggressive fluid resuscitation, which is mandatory in the early phase of ICU course. However recent data strongly suggest that an excessive fluid balance could be detrimental per se (increase of ICU morbidity or even mortality). There are controversies regarding the potential benefit of controlling this fluid balance with diuretics which are commonly used worldwide in various indications (acute and chronic heart failure, chronic kidney failure). In the ICU literature data are lacking, regarding the possible advantages and drawbacks of diuretics in this indication. The aim of our study is to test an algorithm with furosemide to reduce fluid overload in severe ICU-patients.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age of 18 or more\n* Patients receiving endo-tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation during their stay in the ICU\n* Weight increase of at least 3 % during the stay.

Two doses (one placebo, one active) 3 months apart.\n\nSummary:\nThe incidence of tremor in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) has been estimated to affect up to 2/3rds of patients. Over half of the tremors involve the upper limb and frequently lead to further disability. Medical treatment of MS tremor is generally unrewarding, although carbamazepine, clonazepam, glutethimide, hyoscine, isoniazid, ondansetron, primidone, and tetrahydrocannabinol have been reported to have some beneficial effect but published evidence of effectiveness is very limited. The investigators' experience to date suggests that many of the upper limb tremors may potentially be responsive to Botulinum toxin injection therapy.\n\nAims:\n\n1\\. The investigators aim to determine the efficacy of commonly used doses of BOTOX on the patients with symptomatic unilateral or bilateral arm tremor due to MS; and any side effects associated with this treatment.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Relapsing-remitting MS or secondary progressive MS according to the Mc Donald criteria\n* Age 18-80 years of age\n* Competent to understand and sign informed consent\n* Presence of symptomatic head and/or limb tremor\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Treatment with botulinum toxin type A of any brand within the 4 months prior to enrollment\n* A known contraindication to Botox injection\n* Pregnancy\n\nPrimary Outcomes:\n- A decrease in tremor",

Andrea Hospital\nEnrollment: 60 participants\n\nConditions: Multiple Sclerosis\n\nInterventions:\n- DRUG: Interferon-ß-1b - 250 micrograms (8 MIU) administered subcutaneously (sc) every other day with a discontinuance month every 2 months\n- DRUG: Interferon ß-1b - 250 micrograms (8 MIU) administered subcutaneously (sc) every other day\n\nSummary:\nThe therapy with Interferon-ß-1b reduces the inflammatory component of multiple sclerosis with positive effects on the disease course. The 8 MUI dose at alternate days is kept constant for years. About 1/3 of patients suspend treatment by three years due to side effects or suspected or accepted ineffectiveness. The main objective of the study is to verify the safety and effectiveness of a cyclical administration (a month of suspension after two of treatment) from the beginning of treatment. There is the possibility that a scheme envisaging therapy free intervals can reduce the onset of negative feedbacks (antagonising the drug therapeutic effect) compared to the standard administration protocol. This might also result in an increase of the drug effectiveness and/or in a longer duration of effectiveness itself. Finally, cyclical administration allows patients to spend actual periods of \"therapeutic vacation\", with positive psychological effects.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients affected by remitting Multiple Sclerosis who had at least a relapse in the last year of the disease.\n* Satisfying general clinical conditions according to the researcher.

These clinicals demonstrated a reduction of inflammation in all lung and sinus diseases, in patients with COPD, Pulmonary fibrosis, CF, asthma, sinusitis , the flu and nasal inflammation and congestion. Inhaled sodium pyruvate reduces inflammation, congestion and in our phase III clinical study with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis patients we demonstrated statistically and clinical significant increase in FEV-1, SaO2, FVC, FEV-1/FVC ratios (form 52% to 86%) and a decrease in hypoxemia, and a reduction in coughing. Inhaled sodium pyruvate alleviated the symptoms associated with COVID-19 patients in Pulmonary Fibrosis, and may be a solution to the lingering COVID-19 symptoms in patients that had the COVID-19 infection for example long haulers. In flu and COVID infected mice, nebulized sodium pyruvate decreased morbidity, weight loss, inflammatory cytokines and decreased viral titers compared to placebo controls.

RECOVERY trial showed how the use of dexamethasone 6 mg / day for ten days compared to standard treatment without the use of corticosteroids in hospitalized patients reduced mortality at 28 days (22.9% with dexamethasone vs 25.7% without dexamethasone). In the dexamethasone group, the incidence of mortality was lower than standard treatment in patients with hypoxia and the need for mechanical ventilation (29.3% with dexamethasone vs 41.4% without dexamethasone), in patients admitted to the hospital ward with a need for oxygen therapy (23.3% with dexamethasone vs 26.2% without dexamethasone), but they did not find differences between those admitted patients who did not need oxygen therapy. There are two other studies (DEXA-COVID-19 and CoDEX) where they observed benefits of the use of dexamethasone 20 mg / day 5 days, and 10 mg / day 5 days (total 10 days) in patients admitted for respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19.

Approximately 350-400 eligible patients will be stratified and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 800 mg pazopanib once daily or matching placebo. The study treatment will continue until patients experience disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or death. Primary objective of the study is to evaluate and compare the two treatment arms for progression-free survival. Principal secondary objective is to evaluate and compare the two treatment arms with respect to overall survival. Other objectives are overall response rate \\[complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)\\], rate of CR + PR + 6 months stable disease, and the incidence, severity and causality of adverse events and serious adverse events. Safety and efficacy assessments will be regularly performed on all patients. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee will be established to monitor safety during the course of the study and to evaluate interim efficacy data on overall survival.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\n\nA patient will be considered for inclusion in this study only if all of the following criteria apply:\n\n* Signed written informed consent.\n* Diagnosis of clear cell RCC that is predominantly clear cell histology. Note: cytology cannot be the only pathologic criteria to confirm clear cell RCC.

Dexmedetomidine is a sedative medication used mostly in intensive care units,and is marketed under the brand name Precedex. Dexmedetomidine has sedative, analgesic, sympatholytic, and anxiolytic properties. It produces sedation without causing significant respiratory depression. Recent research has suggested dexmedetomidine to be effective in treatment of alcohol withdrawal signs. In previous studies dexmedetomidine was insufficient as an only sedative agent in ERCP and colonoscopy, but it has not been assessed for sedation in patients with chronic pancreatitis. The main objective of this trial is to evaluate if dexmedetomidine can reduce propofol and opioid consumption and facilitate the performance of ERCP in patients with chronic pancreatitis due to drug addiction.Secondary objectives of the trial are the stability of vital signs and safety, patients´ satisfaction plus recovery time from sedation.\n\n50 elective ERCP patients with chronic pancreatitis after written informed consent and randomisation will be recruited to the study. Exclusion criteria are:allergy to propofol, opioid or dexmedetomidine, ASA class greater than 3. All the patients will receive patient-controlled propofol sedation. In dexmedetomidine group dexmedetomidine infusion will be started before sedation beginning and in placebo group placebo-solution (NaCl0,9%) will be administered in the similar manner.Standard monitoring for vital signs will be applied,also sedation degrees will be evaluated with sedation scores. At the end of procedure total amount of propofol and opioid will be calculated,patients and endoscopists satisfaction and the difficulty of ERCP will be assessed.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Elective ERCP-patients with chronic alcohol pancreatitis\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Allergy to the dexmedetomidine, propofol or any opioid, ASA(American Society of Anaesthesiology)class grater when 3\n\nPrimary Outcomes:\n- sedation degree\n- propofol consumption\n- endoscopist´s and patient´s satisfaction\n- vital signs:blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate, breathing rate",

While early patient and graft survival are excellent, long-term outcomes continue to be challenging. Patient death with existing kidney graft function occurs in about half of all recipients over time. This is primarily due to the development of cardiovascular disease in a patient population with multiple preexisting cardiac disease risk factors. There has been little progress in improving outcomes in this area for over two decades. Recent studies in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients using SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), regardless of the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), results in both kidney protective and cardiac protective impacts and improved patient outcomes. However, kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) were excluded from these clinical trials due to concerns that these agents promote infection, diminish graft function, and may alter immunosuppressive drug levels that are the mainstay of patient's transplant therapy. There are limited published data of SGLT2i treatment of selected KTRs.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

Comparative clinical or pharmacodynamic studies, however, between clopidogrel 75 mg od and ticagrelor 60 mg bid in the chronic phase of stable post MI patients have not been performed.\n\nIn a platelet substudy of PEGASUS-TIMI 54, 180 patients who had received \\>4 weeks of study medication had platelet reactivity assessment. Ticagrelor 60mg bid achieved high levels of peak and trough platelet inhibition in nearly all patients, with similar consistency of effect compared to 90mg bid. Platelet reactivity (PRU) was significantly reduced with ticagrelor 60mg bid compared to placebo.\n\nIn light of this, we believe that a dedicated pharmacodynamic study of ticagrelor 60 bid mg vs clopidogrel 75 mg od in a PEGASUS-like population would be informative for the practicing clinician, thus setting the rationale for conducting this specifically designed investigation.\n\nThis is a prospective, randomized, single blind, single center, crossover study. Eligible patients undergoing P2Y12 receptor antagonist therapy before screening will undergo a 14-day minimum washout period before randomization. Following screening/washout period (visit 1), patients will be randomized (visit 2, time 0) in 1:1 fashion to either clopidogrel 75 mg od or ticagrelor 60 mg bid. Following 14±2 days (visit 3) patients will receive alternate treatment for additional 14 days (visit 4). Platelet reactivity assessment will be performed with the VerifyNow P2Y12 reaction assay at time 0, prior to first study drug dose. At visit 3 platelet function will be assessed at 2-4 hours post dose and prior to crossover. At visit 4 also platelet function will be assessed at 2-4 hours post study drug post dose. All patients will receive concomitant aspirin (100 mg/d) and standard secondary prevention medication.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the platelet reactivity measured in P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) at the end of the 2 study periods (pre-crossover and post-crossover).\n\nEligibility Criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures\n2. Post-menopausal female (defined as absence of any vaginal bleeding for a year) or male aged \\>50 years\n3. A spontaneous MI (ST or Non ST segment elevation) 1 to 3 years before enrolment. In addition, at least one of the following high-risk features: age of 65 years or older, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, a second prior spontaneous MI, multivessel coronary artery disease, or non-end stage renal disease (estimated creatinine clearance of \\<60 ml per minute).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Planned use of a P2Y12 receptor antagonist, dipyridamole, cilostazol, or anticoagulant therapy during the study period;\n2. Known allergy, intolerance, hypersensitivity to ticagrelor or clopidogrel or any excipients,\n3. Active pathological bleeding, severe hepatic impairment, a bleeding disorder or a history of an ischemic stroke or intracranial bleeding, a central nervous system tumor, or an intracranial \n\nPrimary Outcomes:\n- platelet reactivity measured in P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) at the end of the 2 study periods (pre-crossover and post-crossover).",
